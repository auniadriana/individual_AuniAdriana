		<p>This day, when I realized that no matter how many times I wanted to be more, if there is no effort then better keep dreaming. It was the day I got my SPM result. It was not the brightest but also not the gloomiest day. I accepted it. With this result, I made it into UiTM. UiTM is where everything started. It was actually the beginning of my life. It was where I got to meet wonderful people.</p>
