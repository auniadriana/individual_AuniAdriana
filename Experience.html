		<center><p>My first experience of working was when I was 18. I was waiting for my SPM result and decided to try my luck finding a job that accept a part-timer. I got lucky when my friend told me there was a vacancy at a clothes shop in GM Klang. I went there and successfully become a part-timer for the first time in my life. It was exhilirating and totally a good experience. It was good to know the great feeling of having a job. There were some ups and downs but everything was worth a try. I only work there for 1 month as I have to attend an important business. Nonetheless, I got along with my colleague and know a thing or two about business.</p></center>

<br>
		<center><p>This is my another experience. I got to experience this when my course demanded me to do a practical at my own chosen library for 6 weeks. Thus, I chose Universiti Malaysia Kelantan as my practical place. Many things are learnt and I found myslef enjoying this opportunity more than I expected. It was a good experience that I would like to repeat again. Being in a library made me felt something I have never felt before. I have been adoring library for so long that I figured out it would be nice to be working in a library some day.</p></center>
